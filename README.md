## Supporting the Project

"Open source" does not mean "includes free support"

You can support the contributor and buy him a coffee.
[![coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/black_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mpokornyetm)
Every second invested in an open-source project is a second you can't invest in your own family / friends / hobby.
That's the reason, why supporting the contributors is so important.

Thx very much for supporting us.

## Features

- **Activity Bar Integration**: Adds a "WinCC OA Projects" item to the VS Code activity bar
- **Project Tree View**: Shows all registered WinCC OA projects in a tree view called "Locale Projects"
- **Project Information Display**: For each project, displays:
  - **Name**: The project name (last part of the installation directory)
  - **Visual Labels**: ‚≠ê Current, üìù Version, ‚úÖ Runnable status
  - **Location**: The full installation directory path  
  - **Created At**: Installation date
  - **Current Status**: Reads `currentProject` property from pvssInst.conf
  - **Version**: WinCC OA version for runnable projects (extracted from config file)
  - **Company**: Optional company information

---

## Project Organization

Projects are automatically sorted in the following order:

1. **Current Projects** (marked with ‚≠ê): Projects currently active/open
2. **WinCC OA Projects** (üöÄ): Main runnable projects with valid config files
3. **WinCC OA Extensions** (üß©): Extensions, plugins, add-ons, and sub-projects

---

## Configuration File Parsing

The extension reads project information from:

- **Main Config**: `C:\ProgramData\Siemens\WinCC_OA\pvssInst.conf`
- **Project Config**: `<InstallationDir>/config/config` (for version information)

### Project Type Classification

**WinCC OA Projects** (runnable) are identified when:

1. The `notRunnable` property is not set to `true` in the main config
2. A `config` file exists in the `<InstallationDir>/config/` directory
3. The config file contains a `[general]` section with a `proj_version` entry

**WinCC OA Extensions** (non-runnable) include:
- Extensions and plugins
- Add-ons and sub-projects
- Project templates
- Component libraries

- **Project View**: Detailed project information view with comprehensive configuration details
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically refreshes when `pvssInst.conf` file changes
- **Click to View**: Click any project in the tree to view detailed information
- **Multiple Open Options**: Open projects in current window or new VS Code instance
- **Extension Points**: Provides extension points for other WinCC OA extensions to hook into

---

## Commands

- **WinCC OA: Refresh Projects**: Manually refresh the project list
- **WinCC OA: Open Project**: Open a project/extension folder in current VS Code window
- **WinCC OA: Open Project in New Window**: Open a project/extension folder in new VS Code instance
- **WinCC OA: Open in Explorer**: Open project/extension location in Windows Explorer
- **WinCC OA: Show Project Details**: Select and display detailed project/extension information

---
