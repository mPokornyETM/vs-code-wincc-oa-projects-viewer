# Automated Release System 🚀

This project uses an **automated release system** that handles versioning, changelog generation, and distribution automatically.

## 📋 How It Works

Every time code is pushed to the `main` branch:

1. ✅ **Tests run** - Code quality checks
2. ✅ **Version bumped** - Semantic versioning based on commits/PR labels
3. ✅ **Changelog updated** - Generated from conventional commits
4. ✅ **GitHub release created** - With release notes and VSIX file
5. ✅ **VS Code Marketplace** - Extension published automatically

## 🤖 Dependabot Integration

**Automated dependency management** keeps your extension secure and up-to-date:

- 📅 **Weekly Updates**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM CET
- 🏷️ **Auto-Labeled**: PRs get `dependencies` and size labels automatically  
- 🔒 **Security Priority**: Security updates marked as `priority/high`
- 📦 **Grouped Updates**: Related dependencies bundled together
- 🚀 **Auto-Release**: Dependency updates trigger patch releases

→ See [DEPENDABOT.md](DEPENDABOT.md) for detailed configuration

## 🎯 For Contributors

### Making Changes

Use **conventional commit format** for all commits:

```
<type>: <description>

Examples:
feat: add new project sorting options
fix: resolve config file parsing issue  
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Commit Types & Version Impact

| Commit Type | Version Bump | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` | Minor (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) | `feat: add drag and drop support` |
| `fix:` | Patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) | `fix: handle missing config files` |
| `docs:` | Patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) | `docs: update README examples` |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major (0.1.0 → 1.0.0) | `feat: redesign API` |

### Helper Script

For Windows users, use the interactive commit helper:

```powershell
.\scripts\commit.ps1
```

This script guides you through creating properly formatted commits.
