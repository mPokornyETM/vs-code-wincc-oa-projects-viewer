## 🚨 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### **1. Do Not File a Public Issue**

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### **2. Report Privately**

Send your report via email to: **[security@winccoa-extension.dev]** (replace with actual email)

Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the security advisory form

### **3. Include in Your Report**

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: VS Code version, OS, extension version
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots if applicable
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### **Example Report Format**

```text
Subject: [SECURITY] Potential Path Traversal in Config File Handling

Environment:
- Extension Version: 1.0.0
- VS Code Version: 1.85.0
- OS: Windows 11

Description:
The extension's config file parsing functionality may be vulnerable to path traversal attacks...

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a malicious config file with "../" sequences
2. Place it in the WinCC OA project directory
3. Open the project in VS Code
4. Observe that files outside the project directory are accessible

Impact:
An attacker could potentially read sensitive files outside the project directory...

Suggested Fix:
Implement proper path validation and sanitization...
```

## ⏰ **Response Timeline**

| Phase | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Initial Response** | 48 hours | Acknowledgment of report |
| **Assessment** | 5 business days | Vulnerability validation and severity assessment |
| **Fix Development** | 2-4 weeks | Develop and test security fix |
| **Disclosure** | Coordinated | Public disclosure after fix is released |

## 🛡️ **Security Measures**

### **Extension Security**

- **Code Scanning**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks for dependencies
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs and file paths
- **Sandboxing**: Extension runs in VS Code's secure extension host
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary VS Code API permissions

### **Data Protection**

- **Local Storage Only**: No data transmitted to external servers
- **File System Access**: Limited to project directories only
- **Registry Access**: Read-only access to WinCC OA installation registry
- **Process Execution**: Restricted to WinCC OA utilities in safe directories

### **Secure Development**

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules and TypeScript strict mode
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed for security implications
- **Testing**: Security-focused test cases and penetration testing

## 🔍 **Known Security Considerations**

### **File System Access**

The extension accesses the Windows file system for:

- Reading WinCC OA project configuration files
- Executing WinCC OA utilities (pmon, etc.)
- Parsing registry entries for project discovery

**Mitigations:**

- Path validation and sanitization
- Restricted to configured project directories
- Read-only access where possible

### **Process Execution**

The extension may execute WinCC OA system utilities:

- `pmon.exe` for project management operations
- Configuration tools for project setup

**Mitigations:**

- Whitelist of allowed executables
- Validation of executable paths
- Sandboxed execution environment

### **Registry Access**

The extension reads Windows registry for project discovery:

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ETM\WinCC_OA
- Project installation paths and versions

**Mitigations:**

- Read-only registry access
- Validation of registry data
- Graceful handling of missing keys
